# Pmod D mikroShield
The Pmod D mikroShield is a mikroBUS<sup>TM</sup> to Pmod<sup>TM</sup> host add-on board. The pinout is guaranteed to work for a SPI Pmod<sup>TM</sup> device. On many controllers, including Connaxio's Espoir devboard, this adapter enables Pmod<sup>TM</sup> GPIO, SPI, I<sup>2</sup>C, UART, H-bridge and their dual and expanded versions (Types 1 to 6A).

The Pmod<sup>TM</sup> connector can also be used with breadboard jumper cables to connect many breakout boards, such as the ones distributed by Adafruit and SparkFun.
